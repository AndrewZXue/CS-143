In the left side bar of our web, we create 5 add functions and 1 search function. These 5 add functions include adding person (I1), adding movie (I2), adding a relation between the actor and the movie (I4), adding a relation between the director and the movie (I5), and adding comments to movies (I3). The search function allows us to search keywords both for actors and movies (S1). By clicking on the name or title, we can redirect to a new page that shows detailed information about the actor (B1) or the movie (B2). Also, we add a link in the movie information page redirecting to add comment page.

We split the 9 php files into 4 and 5. The person who wrote less php pages is responsible for combining all the php files together. We had a great and efficient collaboration with equal work amount.
