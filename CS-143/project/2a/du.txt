< i would normally agree with you but in such odd political times—the result of which being a trump regime—it isn't out of the question to attribute a couple larger narratives to the gop winning . i.e . dnc incompetence and russian interference . but yes i understand your point being that most of the population can only consume one political stance at a time .

< when the tea party took over they boosted the conservative values part of the conservative movement , which included a lot of religious people , unfortunately the very fervent religious people evangelicals . . . they are prone to follow people which is poetic since their bible says not to do that . once someone tells them follow this person they will do so with all the passion of a hungry dog chasing a steak . that is how they refuse to admit trump is not at all like a christian . there are intelligent conservatives , but they are kind of stuck without a home , but honestly that old version of conservatism where the government shouldn't be involved is probably impossible with how the world is changing . between ai and automation something is going to have to change and a strong government will probably be key .
